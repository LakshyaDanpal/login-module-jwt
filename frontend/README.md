🔐 React Login Module with JWT Authentication
📘 Overview

This project is a React.js-based login module that demonstrates how JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication works in a frontend application.

Since there is currently no backend or database connection, a static test case is used to simulate user authentication.

🧩 Features

Built using React.js

Implements JWT token generation on login

Simple login validation using a static email and password

Displays the JWT token on successful login

Styled with basic CSS (no Tailwind or external UI library)

Includes a checkbox for user interaction (e.g., “Remember me”)

🧠 How It Works

The user enters the following credentials:

Email: test@example.com

Password: 123456

Upon clicking the Login button, the app validates these credentials.

If valid, it displays a “Login Successful” message along with a JWT token generated on the frontend.

The JWT token is visible directly on the page for demonstration purposes.

⚙️ Future Enhancements

Connect the module to a backend API for dynamic authentication.

Integrate a database (e.g., MongoDB, MySQL) to manage user credentials.

Add error handling and form validation for better UX.

Improve UI using Tailwind CSS or a React component library.
