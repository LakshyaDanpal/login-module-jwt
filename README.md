JWT Login Module (React.js)
Overview

This project is a simple login module built using React.js that demonstrates authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
It is a frontend-only implementation that does not connect to a backend database. The purpose of this module is to demonstrate the login functionality and JWT generation process in a React application.

Features

Developed using React.js.

Implements JWT authentication for demonstration.

Displays a JWT token upon successful login.

Includes a "Remember Me" checkbox.

Uses basic CSS for styling (no Tailwind or external UI frameworks).

Uses a static test user for authentication since no backend is connected.

Test Credentials

Use the following credentials to test the login functionality:

Field	Value
Email	test@example.com

Password	123456

Logging in with these credentials will display a success message along with a JWT token.

Implementation Details

The entire authentication logic is handled in the frontend.

JWT is generated locally for demonstration purposes.

No backend or database integration is included.

The structure allows for easy future integration with a backend API.

Technologies Used

React.js

JavaScript (ES6)

CSS3

JSON Web Token (JWT)

Future Enhancements

Integrate with a real backend API for authentication.

Add server-side JWT verification.

Implement error handling and input validation.

Add logout and session management features.

Summary

This module serves as a basic prototype to demonstrate the working of a JWT-based login system in a React.js environment. It can be extended further by adding backend connectivity and secure authentication mechanisms.
